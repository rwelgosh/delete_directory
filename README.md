# delete_directory
Simply python algorithm to run from the command terminal to delete a directory and it's contents. (Made for practice of my own python skills)

Right now it should list all the files in the current directory. Does not allow for you to switch directories within the program. Must change directories before execution
but may only work if it is in that directory. Still have to get around a few bugs like that.
